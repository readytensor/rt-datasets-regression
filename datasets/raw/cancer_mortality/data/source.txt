Summary
The goal of this project/challenge is to predict the results of Cancer Mortality Rates with the following constraint, to construct an OLS regression model.

The website hosting the data is located at https://data.world/nrippner/ols-regression-challenge. These data were aggregated from a number of sources including the American Community Survey (https://www.census.gov), https://www.clinicaltrials.gov, and https://www.cancer.gov.

Using only OLS to build the model, the final model chosen uses 6 predictors, out of 36 total, with an adjusted R-squared of 0.9614.

Background
These data were aggregated from a number of sources including the American Community Survey (census.gov), clinicaltrials.gov, and cancer.gov. Most of the data preparation process can be veiwed at https://data.world/nrippner/cancer-trials.

Joins from clinicaltrials.gov, cancer.gov & census.gov to examine cancer trials, mortality, incidence and demographics

Your Task: Build a multivariate Ordinary Least Squares regression model to predict "TARGET_deathRate"
